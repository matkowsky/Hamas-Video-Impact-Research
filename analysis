Research Notes
Documenting the research process and findings from October 2023 to September 2024.

I. Methodology

Data Collection:
Data was collected from primary sources, including hostage videos released by Hamas, and secondary sources such as news articles and academic studies. Social media analytics were gathered from platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and TikTok.

Statistical Analysis:
Multivariate regression analysis was employed to control for variables such as government actions, economic conditions, and media coverage. This helped isolate the impact of hostage videos on protest dynamics.

Qualitative Analysis:
In-depth contextual analysis was performed to understand the psychological and societal impact of the hostage videos.

II. Summarized Findings

Hostage Videos and Protests:
Hostage videos were found to have a significant impact on protest activity, particularly within 48 hours of their release. The intensity and frequency of protests increased in correlation with the timing of these videos.

Psychological Impact:
The videos were linked to increased levels of anxiety and PTSD among the Israeli population, contributing to heightened social unrest.

Global Disinformation:
Hamas's use of disinformation campaigns, synchronized with the release of these videos, amplified their impact both domestically and internationally.

III. Statistical Analysis

Regression Analysis:
The regression analysis confirmed that the release of hostage videos is a significant predictor of protest intensity, even after controlling for other variables.

Comparative Analysis:
The findings were compared with other conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and Syria, where similar tactics were employed.
