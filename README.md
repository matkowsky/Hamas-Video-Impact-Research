# Analysis of Protests in Israel During the 2023-2024 Conflict

## Overview
This repository contains data, analysis scripts, and the final report on the factors influencing protests in Israel during the 2023-2024 conflict with Hamas. The research explores the impact of hostage videos, global diplomatic efforts, and socio-economic conditions on the intensity and frequency of protests.

Disclaimer: Nature of ChatGPT Research
This repository includes research and analysis that was conducted with the assistance of OpenAI's ChatGPT, an AI language model based on the GPT-4 architecture. While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for generating content, analysis, and suggestions, it has inherent limitations that should be considered when interpreting the information presented in this repository:

Generative AI: The research and analysis provided by ChatGPT are generated based on patterns learned from a large dataset of text. While this allows for insightful and relevant outputs, the AI does not have direct access to current databases, live data, or the ability to independently verify real-time information. The content generated is based on available data up to its last training cut-off in September 2021, and any newer information is either simulated or based on prompts provided by the user.

Lack of Direct Verification: While efforts have been made to cross-check and verify the data against reliable sources, the AI does not inherently verify the accuracy of the generated content in real time. Users should treat the findings as a starting point and ensure that any critical information is verified through independent, reputable sources before being used in decision-making processes.

Context and Specificity: The AI may produce generalized or context-specific information that may not perfectly align with all real-world scenarios. The applicability of the research to specific cases may require further expert review and adaptation.

Ethical and Legal Considerations: The AI-generated research, particularly in sensitive areas such as psychological warfare and hybrid conflicts, should be used with caution. Ethical and legal considerations should be taken into account, and the research should be contextualized within broader frameworks of responsible conduct.

Recommendations and Future Research: The repository may include suggestions or recommendations for further research. These should be viewed as potential directions rather than definitive conclusions and should be pursued with appropriate rigor and scrutiny.
