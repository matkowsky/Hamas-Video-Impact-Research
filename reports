# Final Report: Influence of Hostage Videos, Global Diplomatic Efforts, and Socio-Economic Factors on Domestic Protests in Israel During the 2023-2024 Conflict

## Introduction
This report explores the factors influencing domestic protests in Israel during the 2023-2024 conflict, focusing on hostage videos, global diplomatic efforts, and socio-economic conditions.

## Section 1: Hostage Videos as Catalysts
Hostage videos released by Hamas were significant triggers for protests, particularly when amplified by media coverage. These videos led to widespread public outrage and large-scale protests.

## Section 2: Government Military Actions and Communication Strategies
The IDF's military operations in Gaza were controversial due to their high civilian toll. The Israeli government's communication strategy, which focused on justifying these actions, faced significant domestic and international criticism, contributing to further unrest.

## Section 3: Global Diplomatic Efforts and Solidarity Movements
International diplomatic efforts, particularly those by the UN, US, and EU, played a role in shaping public opinion in Israel. Global solidarity movements, amplified by social media, also influenced domestic protests, although their impact may have been overstated.

## Section 4: Socio-Economic Factors
Economic conditions in Israel, including rising unemployment and inflation, exacerbated public dissatisfaction and contributed to the intensity of protests.

## Conclusion
The protests during the 2023-2024 conflict were driven by a complex interplay of factors, with hostage videos acting as significant triggers within a broader context of economic stress, military actions, and international pressures.
